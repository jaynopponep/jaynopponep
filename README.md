### Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jay

I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at the City College of New York. I'm open to learn more skills, work on something new, and refine my current projects. 
I'm currently working on frameworks like ReactJS and Flask to enhance my web development skills. I'm also learning PyGame to start learning game development for fun! 
In the future, I plan on digging into ML/AI concepts and projects, cloud engineering with AWS, and backend & data management.
